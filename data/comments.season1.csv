"Looking back at this teaser, I love how much they have improved in season 2’s teaser, so excited"
Taylor
A now a teaser trailer for Season 2 is coming out today!! I’M SO EXCITED!!! 💛🌻🫶
When are yall dropping season 2&#39;s teaser.. plsss its been a yearr!!
I felt like a teenager again while watching this. I love the whole cast. Everyone is so good looking. Can’t wait for season 2! 🥰
"I don&#39;t like belly coz how could she plays  with three boys heart😭 😡 It was okay to kiss Cam ,The very bad thing is how could she kiss her crush brother 😡 shame on her😡 She has to be patient for her first love but she didn&#39;t and plays with a lots of hearts . I hope from now on I will never gonna  watch love story stuff anymore and I&#39;m not gonna watch season 2 of this series. I just wasted my 6 hours to watch all episodes of season 1 and I didn&#39;t sleep coz this series took  my sleep away  and I hate it the  most. It was my very bad night ever.😡 I&#39;m regretting that I wasted my time by watching  season 1 and I&#39;m pretty sure that I wouldn&#39;t gonna regret by watching season 2 in upcoming days. How could love story be such a nasty thing anymore. watching this season , i started to hate love story series and movies and I&#39;ll never watch such bad stuff again 😡"
Whats the genre of the series/movie….<br><br><br>Taylor Swift. Period.
the last episode 😭😭😭😭
Season 1 was an emotional rollercoaster.
this advert and song pisses me off sm always interrupting my spotify
The series is good no lie😭😭 loved every episode! But the volleyball episode was something else. The song choices and everything about the tournament was PERFECT!
"OMG OMG OMG OMG recién me empecé a leer los libros, ya voy por el tercero y OMG"
Taylor voice is like heaven🤍
when will it be my summer to turn pretty
10/10 recommend watching.
"the songs, the cast, the dynamic between friends and lovers, it’s on point I love this adaptation."
i hated this book lol she dumped a nice dude that seemed amazing
"In the series, Jere is better than conrad period."
"I’ve never read the books, but I’m totally skipping Jer with Belly &amp; I’m only 20 mins in the first episode!"
Team Jer here! Oh! Please give us something unpredictable in S2 . Please! 💕
❤️🖤
Watched this series just because of Taylor. And it was great
Song name please
"tylor is the reason i am watching teenage movies.  anyway, its a nice  novel"
I just binged the whole series and loved it so much❤
"hi, i am here again. i believe this teaser is my happy pill. &lt;3"
Why is her name Belly tho 😭
"the amount of replays that i am doing ugggghhhh, i wanna watch it now :))"
one of them is really cute. not cute enough to suffer through this. ill catch him on google images
im team conrad for sure
EXACTLY WHAT I IMAGINED IN THE BOOKS 🥰😍
Um I think it’s weird that she likes both of the brothers because even if she does choose one of them wouldn’t it be awkward anyways…👁👄👁
Tell me that she&#39;s not going to be with the first boy 😶
can i live CAN I LIVEEEEEEEEEE
Can we get a movie or show for Maybe someday!!!!
Emotionally I know I am not ready but the excitement just cancels out any crying
THE AMOUNT OF TIMES  I WATCH THIS TRAILER EVERYDAY IM GONNA RUIN IT FOR MYSELF WITHA SPOILER OR SOMETTHING DGJHFGJLHSFJGHFJKLS
I can&#39;t wait
TEAM CONRAD FOREVER!!!!!!
What it be like when your mums friends are mainly family or the children they have are girls or younger kids like 10 years gap
"Give Taylor a cameo, and I&#39;m gonna add this series to watchlist ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
i watched this trailer literally a million times 😂
The fact that this comes out the begining of exam week is just so horrible for me
Okay Taylor fans here 🥺❤️!!!! This is the most perfect song for this series&#39;🥺💕 her voice and this song is meant to be in this series 😭❤️
"I didn&#39;t realize it&#39;s a series so that means longer and a lot from the book can be included. I&#39;m reading this right now, so I&#39;m looking forward to watch this. I love watching coming of age kind of theme, plus Taylor Swift&#39;s song PERFECT!"
"LOL for those saying this reminds them of The Kissing Booth, To All The Boys &amp; The Vampire Diaries the fun fact is I thought Jeremiah&#39;s actor, Gavin looked familiar... it turns out because he played the tween Damon in the later seasons of The Vampire Diaries!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>EDIT:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>SPOILERS</b><br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sVWSRKB7Vo&amp;t=29"">0:29</a> Just from this scene alone it seems to hint who she is destined to be with... they say true love always finds a way."
I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE THIS IS REAL!!!!!!!
After fucking years of waiting and Taylor Swift makes it so much better 😭❤
when I tell you I am tearing up right now because this was one of my favorite books 🥺
we will be tuning in 🤞🏽
OMG IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS TO FINALLY COME OUT DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IVE BEEN WAITING IT ACTUALLY LOOKS SO GOOD CANT WAIT AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
Mañana sale el trailer!!<br>Aaahhhhhh
Taylor!!!! I LOVE HER
i just finished reading the third book and now this!!! can&#39;t wait
I was 16 when this came out and although I&#39;m in my late 20s I&#39;m super excited about it.
&quot;how many times have you watched this?&quot;<br><br><br>me: <b>yes</b>
Another trash movie by Boba liberal Jenny Han!
♥️
Why does this have to be on Amazon I been waiting for this for at least 10 years
I can&#39;t wait for these. But please don&#39;t tell me I am not the only one who wants them to change like...the entire book 3 storyline. Just me?
I hope the series will be as good as the books. I&#39;ve been waiting for so long for this. Fingers crossed
"To all the boys I have loved trilogy was really good but I wasn&#39;t team Peter,  who is gonna be the peter here becoz I didn&#39;t like him much in the books . Lara deserved lot better"
The best about this trailer is they don&#39;t give too spoilers than other trailers today
currently reading the first book and omg i cannot waitttt
Can we only see this on prime or can we watch it somewhere else
"OML I JUST GOT THIS TRILOGY LIKE 2 DAYS AGO AND THOUGHT ‘I really like these books, I wonder if they’re turned into a movie’ BUT OMG THEYRE MAKING A SERIES AHHHHHH I COULDN’T BE MORE EXCITED"
im so hyped for thiss
"I&#39;ll come here everyday until the series launches, I&#39;m so in love with the trailer &amp; the song ofc"
Idk how many times i&#39;ve already watched this  i&#39;m just too excited ackkkkk
will there be another trailer or is the teaser the only thing we get before the show is released?
Did you notice that anytime it said “bad” it was on Conrad and when it said “good” it was on Jeremiah?
"Lola Tung(?) is crazy beautiful! Anyone know anything about her (her age, in particular)? I’m just curious. This looks like her first ever project(?)! I’d like to know how she was discovered, for one! <br><br>Also, I didn’t read the books, but I agree with people who say they got the casting right.<br><br>I like that this actress actually LOOKS just about the age of the girl she’s portraying (I don’t know for sure though, and obviously can’t say for the two male lead actors, either?)"
"It’s been two weeks, Amazon. Give us a real trailer."
brb…definitely re reading the series before this comes out :)))))
"I’m so excited for this, it already looks so good and hearing Taylor made it even better!!"
"people are so mean when it comes to the actor who plays conrad, people are judging before the show even starts, I think both he and the actor who plays jeremiah are perfect"
OH! MY! GOD! EXCITEDDDD!!!!!!
i happily forgot this series ever existed
Never thought i could be so obsessed with just a teaser ♥️♥️♥️ because of 2 reasons : 1. Its of the book the summer i turned pretty 😍♥️♥️ 2. The song omg Taylor Swift the love absolute masterpiece ❤️❤️❤️❤️ can&#39;t wait for 17th june ♥️♥️♥️♥️<br>Already watched it like 50 times ♥️

This trailer drives me to look up books and now I have read all those sequels in 3 days. Can&#39;t wait to watch this adaptation movie ......
I loved this book series when I was younger! I was in my early 20s when I first read the books and have read them many time since. I need to reread them again before this comes out. So excited!
Ok I‘ve watched this way too many times already and I ordered the books yesterday 🥹
"I can&#39;t believe my favourite book, and the first book I read that made me fall in love with books has finally been turned into a series. Ahhh!!! The wait is over😍"

OMG ! This is my favorite novel !!!
WHY AM I ADDICTED TO THE TRAILER
Is cam Cameron gonna be in this?
Does it release in India
Only God knows how many times I repeated this trailer
i&#39;m an adult but my teen heart is all tingly inside (Dang it)
"My favourite book growing up, so excited for this!"
The way they keep making the books I read in middle school into movies and shows ❤  keep it goinggggg!!!
I love this book series!!! I hope the show is as good!
why is it always white boys
"Never read any of the books nor have I ever known about this series, but this is giving off major main character die vibes"
so excited
That beach scene with Conrad in Book 3 is coming back to me all of a sudden.
I liked this book series way more than To All the Boys. And the characters too. I usually stay away from adaptations because I feel like they ruin the books for me but I think I&#39;m giving this one a chance. I hope it won&#39;t disappoint.
This looks good
What kind of title  is that for a movie. Honey we all are pretty in are own way throughout the year not just summertime big ppl skinny ppl short ppl tall ppl and so on.... But the movie or show is alright
I can&#39;t wait any longer
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😊😊😊😊😘😘😘😘
I really loved the book&#39;s Belly and Conrad are perfect looking forward to this.
i’ve reread this series like 10 times i’m so excited 😭
"Woahh is this really happening?!!! I&#39;m so excited! This will be so nostalgic for me, it takes me back to being young and reading the books fist thing after school......now I&#39;ve graduated college already😭"
i rlly see this and think of me in seventh grade falling in love with the trilogy and then i think on how i’m graduating high school next week and it all hits. &lt;3
the way i&#39;ve watched this  trailer so many times already :( lets hope it does it justice way better than to all the boys i&#39;ve loved before to all you OG book lovers of jenny han pre-movie
One of the best Taylor swift songs IMO! Loved that it features here
Read this series waaay before To All the Boys…it’s still my favorite.  Jenny Han had me hooked!  I’m so excited!!!
This Love ❤
June 17th needs to get here fast!!!
"I’m gonna cry 😭 😱😱😱 I read this book a thousand times when I was 15,16!!!!!!  I begged the author to make a movie out of it because of how obsessed I was with this movie!!!!! 🤞🏻⭐️😱👑😭😭😂😂😂😂  this couldn’t have come out at a perfect time in my life 😂😂"
"Não gosto dos livros, odeio os homens fisher, mas to louca p aasistir"
Me smiling the entire time watching it😅
OMGGGGG BEEN A FAN OF THIS TRILOGY SINCE HIGH SCHOOL 😭❤  CONRAD&#39;S GONNA BREAK MY HEART AGAIN 😭
Stop wasting Good movies with tyler songs......
I’m excited to see this even tho I never read the book or don’t know anything about this
Is anyone else annoyed by all the swifties in the comments? Just let me pretend I&#39;m in middle school again reading this series for the first time and celebrate the fact we&#39;re seeing it on screen
I love Taylor&#39;s voice😍
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Its bad how many times I&#39;ve watched this trailer.🤣
When is it coming out?
I read this book in 2010 now I&#39;m 28 geez I feel old! I think all swifties we love this trilogy.
"This song perfectly encapsulates the dynamic between Conrad and Belly. I loved reading these books, and can’t wait to see this!!"
screaming cry throwing up
Been dreaming of a movie/tv series of TSITP since it was first published - add in Taylor and I’m crying 10x harder 🥺 can’t wait for this series to come out! ✨
Such a good song is wasted on this frustrating storyline. I hated the mcs sm in the books but imma stil try to watch this coz I am a masochist 🥲
One of my absolute favorite Taylor Swift songs to go along with an adaptation of one of my favorite book series?! I need a moment to soak up this perfection. Everyone is cast so well and it&#39;s already looking great!
yall have no IDEA how long ive been waiting for a The Summer I Turned Pretty adaptation. I read this book in middle school and now im in college!
Taylor 😿
This deserves to be on Netflix like To All The Boys was
It still feels like a fever dream that this lovely lovely series is being adapted into a show I cannot wait 😭😭😭❤️❤️
"I’ve wished for a long time that they would bring these books to life! I love the books so much, I am so happy!!! 😆😆😆😆"
"This looks promising, Amazon. <br>Can you do more of wlw stuff tho? Not in this movie i mean, a separate one. I&#39;d love that and I&#39;m sure many others would love that too."
euroasians are taking over the world. they are just the most beautiful people ive ever seen
The number of times I&#39;ve watched this teaser trailer. I am currently reading the second book in this series and this series has a chokehold on me.
When are you guys starting Citadel promtion? It better be good and big if the show is big and expensive.
"Great, a romantic teen movie that I can’t relate too at all…"
I can not even express how excited I am for this honestly dream come true moment I am so obsessed with the books that I’ve read it like 10 times over and have always wanted a movie to come out I’m just hoping they make all 3 movies just like the books 😱😱😱😱
This love by Taylor Swift gave this trailer an interesting new experience.
CAN&#39;T WAIT
SCREAMING
Who else came here for Taylor not for movie?
"I think book series being adapted make so much more sense to be adapted into tv series. Like look at bridgerton. Even though the to all the boys films were super successful, think about how much more development could have been done if it were 3 seasons rather than movies"
Taylor singing song for this series is 👏👌❤️
Taylors songs are always good
i love jennie and my name is han what a wonderful♥
goshh i might started watching a series because Taylor Swift song playing on the trailer 😂
OMG
Just compeleted the whole trilogy &amp; I am here to check whether the actors would do any justice to the story with their acting &amp; so far I feel like it is going to be fun. The cast looks perfect so far!!
1989 supremacy
"Dollar bills, dollar bills<br>Watch it falling for me, I love the way that feels<br>Dollar bills, dollar bills<br>Keep on falling for me, I love the way it feels"
Read the book when I was a teenager now I’m 27 but still excited 🤣
Fun fact: There is a kid in my grade that looks like Jeremiah
I love the books! I actually still have them. I’m excited to see the show
I just finished the first book so I could see what they change/keep and can we just take a second to ask WTF WAS FIRST BOOK ENDING 🫣🫣🫣
I cant wait for this too come out!
shes so pretty
Thankyouuniverse ✨
pelo amor de deus faz 10 anos que li os livros eu n lembro mais com quem ela termina q ódio kkkkk

ELI REACT TO DEATH GTIPS
my favorite book and TAYLOR BYE NY LIFE IS COMPLETE
ahh im so excited
This looks dumb
So many of Taylor&#39;s songs could fit within TSITP series. I hope they will collab and include more of her songs in the show.
Thought it was a documentary... 🥲
these books are so so so good and jenny is such a great writer ahhhhhhhhh
"I hope that i&#39;am not expressing myself in the wrong way, but , the message of the books is  what is most important is beauty?"
i cant wait
Ironically this is how I pictured Lara Jean to look
A movie about being attractive seems redundant given that you have to be attractive to be in a movie
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS. The fact that my FAVORITE book series is gonna be turned into a show?!?? INCREDIBLE
Oh I love this book trilogy 😍
Love this so much ❤️
Why can&#39;t I find it on my prime video ??? 😫 m from India 😩😩😩😩😩
I hear Taylor I like the video
We’re caught up playing the impassioned protagonist in our Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈
"What is the scene @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sVWSRKB7Vo&amp;t=53"">0:53</a> from? With the girl holding the camera. She&#39;s cute af."
Taylor Swift song made this more interesting and kind of emotional...
I’m pretty sure I read this series before “To All the Boys” and they’re both amazing!<br><br>I’m so excited!
I&#39;m proud to be taylor&#39;s fan.
💙
omggggg this vibe
POV: more than half of these views are from Swifties
<b>&quot;HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU WATCH IT?&quot;</b><br><b>YES</b>
Y’all I’m excited but I also feel like this could ruin the books for me because none of them are how I pictured them

This show has been keeping me going since august I CANT WAITTT AND TSYLORR AHH MY LIFE IS SO GREAT
Cringey af
the way this is gonna be so good. swiftie &amp; a jenny han fan?? best combo 💋
The belly flop huhuhuhuhu
"But they changed belly&#39;s line<br><br>Book:<br>&quot;I like you better with glasses.&quot;<br>&quot;Well, to bad. My contacts are here to stay.&quot;<br><br>Movie:<br>&quot;I like you better with glasses.&quot;<br>&quot;Too bad, I like me better without &#39;em.&quot;"
"oh my gosh, give me a fucking break"
So proud of Taylor <br>Her songs did justice to this series <br>By the way the trailer looks good!
whos here because of tiktok
AWWWWWWSOMMMME❤❤
I&#39;m definitely watching this 😍😍😍
SHE TURNED PRETTY!!
the chills i got from watching this &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
TAYLOR AND THE GUY WHO PLAYED KID DAMON.
"There is a common theme on girl&#39;s love stories, they love to be the center of attraction between 2 guys who are as equally hot for her to choose.🤣🤣🤣"
"When I read the books all those years ago, I was Team Conrad. But when Jeremiah sees Belly step out of that car in this trailer... <b>oof</b>"
I AM SO FREAKING EXCITED FOR THIS SERIES!! the characters (Actors) are so talented &amp; it&#39;s giving sm amazing summer vibess
Morbius Sweeps
Ahh... none of the characters look like how I pictured them. Glad this series is getting it&#39;s moment
"&quot; i like you better with glasses .&quot;<br>&quot; Too bad , I like me without them ! &quot; <br>Finally someone said it !"
"blessings, greetings from the Dominican Republic"
I&#39;m obsessed
this cast is stunning
Belly’s brother is really cute 💕
"i hope they stick to the book, I really want to see Cameron but he&#39;s nowhere to be found in this trailer😩"
Oh I’m about to fall<br>For someone from this show…
Omg is this going to be a poly romance???? Im here for it if it is 💖💚💙
Jere looks more cute :p
Most unrelatable movie title I&#39;ve ever seen
Thia was my favorite book when I was younger! I had no idea that it&#39;s going to be a movie😪
ive been waiting for so lonnggg i cant wait any longer!! I LOVE THE CASTS SM
taylor song fits this series cant wait to see this
I fell in love with the models on the covers of the books but at the same time I&#39;m actually happy Belly is Asian because Jenny Han is so I think it might actually ring more true to her voice... and so happy this was finally made to counteract the obvious plagiarism that was the cringey Kissing Booth series lol
IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS!!!! i LOVED the book series :’)
oh my gooooosh i love this book esp conrad 🫢🫶
THIS LOVE😭🫶🏻
HOLLERINGGGGG

I love these books and Taylor swift!! never in my wildest dreams did I think these two were gunna collide just like this
"OMG I LOVE THIS BOOK SERIES!! I CANT BELIEVE THEYRE MAKING IT A SHOW!! I remember randomly finding this book at Chapters and being curious about it just because of the title. Picked it up and the rest is history. I read these books so long ago - before I got married, before I had a kid. This is so nostalgic for me, aaaaaahhhhhhhh its peak early 2010s for me. I can’t wait for this 🥹🥹🥹"
"I’m honestly impressed by the time and effort you put into these videos, Keep it up!💛"

Taylor doing her second movie soundtrack song !
Very excited for this. I remember waiting for a year between books and accosting Jenny at a party demanding to know which brother Belly ultimately chooses. 😂😂 She was like who do you want her to choose?? She had me there I couldn’t decide either although I definitely had opinions! I hope Amazon does all three books!

Haha I literally had a summer I got pretty 😂 July 2007 my dad got me contact lenses but unfortunately they weren&#39;t ready for prom lol. I remember the first time all my fellow class mates saw me was in the August when we went to collect GCSE&#39;s. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d EVER had so many people looking at me before. Lads that had picked on me for years because I wore glasses and was Aurburn with ginger streaks couldn&#39;t take they&#39;re eyes off me 😂😂😂😂 Felt so F-ing Amazing lol
Something told me I had to watch this series and now I have a reason to do it

1989 eraaaaaaa
"AAAAAAAAHHH<br>NO TIENEN IDEA DE LO EMOCIONADA QUE ESTOY!!!!<br>CONRAD, JEREMIAH Y NUESTRA HERMOSA BELLY, LOS AMOOOO.<br>NOS VEMOS EN EL VERANO."
A movie probably would have been better. Get a bigger audience that way. Follow the Netflix model. Get in and get out. Make a sequel if its a success.
TAYLOR MY BELOVEEEED

Omg this song is now like an anthem

"Over the past year Wildest Dreams, Bad Blood and now This Love have been used in trailers. 1989 has to be next! It just makes sense - the songs on there appear to be in demand and surely it has the vibe of a summer release"
