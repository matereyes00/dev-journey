"I simply cannot ship Conrad with Bella. She&#39;s clearly using the Fisher brothers as emotional crutches, and frankly, Conrad deserves far better. Now Aubrey? That&#39;s a ship I could get behind.I&#39;d rather see him with Aubrey, to be honest."

Ahhh I can’t wait!!!!❤❤❤
"Okay, but can we talk about how Conrad/Belly completely kept that unexpect Christmas Eve night reunion at the beach house completely secret from Jere in the books?… how is it that Jere gets all this hate from a one-night-stand during spring break a few months later after he and Belly were “on a break”, when he was such a loyal, honest, committed boyfriend for her for 2 years and came clean about what happened and said he was drunk and heartbroken, and it only happened once, and immediately regretted it and said he would work on himself to make it up to Belly…but Belly/Conrad are totally fine keeping their night together at the beach house a deep dark secret like that from Jere? 😖 Seriously, it’s not fair, and I hope the show gives us a plot twist about Belly/Conrad kissing at the beach house on that Christmas night and Belly immediately regretting it and confessing to Jere about it and asking for his forgiveness… and that’s how the drama starts. Jere did not deserve to be done dirty in the books. 😢"

The transition between Daylight to RED!!!! My gosh it&#39;s crazy!! The &#39;Red&#39; lyrics fit them so well «remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes tell myself it&#39;s time now gotta let go but moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head in burning red». Gosh those 5 seconds of Belly and Conrad made the whole trailer for me!!!
"Fantastic video, really appreciate your effort!"

Although connie wasn&#39;t as good as Jeremiah when it came to being belly&#39;s boyfriend i kinda wanted her to be with him it was just so sad that he was alone

Bad acting. Cliches. Same “who’s she gonna choose” I cannot wait to make fun of this.
Red being Conrad and Belly’s song meanwhile in the poster of the three of them she was wearing red? Also the poster being a copy of the Sabrina one? Bonrad endgame!!!
"“I once believe love would be burning red, but it’s golden”<br>into<br>“but loving him was red”<br><br>Is actually peak use of Taylor’s music and lore, I love it SO MUCH."

JELLY IS SO CUTEEE IN THIS TRAILER ❤️
"Fantastic explanation, thank you!"
"I&#39;m sooooooooooooooo very sad the show is going to follow the books. Jeremiah is a much better fit for her... I know in the books he messes up severely, but I don&#39;t see how this Jeremiah we grew to love and that has always been there for her would EVER do that... so out of character. Too bad!"
I’ve never been more excited for a season before
“hey” 👅👅👅
I HATE GODAMN JEREMIAH
Oh my goodnessssssssss❤

The fact that she hasn’t made up her mind is so annoying
The editing is top-tier. Seriously impressive
"And everyone else on here saying that the minute Conrad said &quot;hey&quot; they knew chaos was about to ensue, tells a lot about the relationship dynamics of Belly and Conrad.<br><br>It&#39;s chaotic, but then we mistake chaos for electric.<br>We mistake those feelings of uncertainty and jitters for &#39;electric love&#39; or a love that is consuming.<br><br>And you would be right, it is consuming, but not in the good way. It&#39;s consuming in the way that it makes you lose your good sense and keep falling into bad decisions you&#39;ve made before,  <br>Because you&#39;re only addicted to the feeling."
But if Taylor says daylight is the &quot;right real love&quot; why would red be the better choice?

"Listen. <br>In my opinion, this whole drama is a perfect example of how some females,  although they have a guy that loves them, cherishes them, thinks the world of them and is ready to treat them right,  choose the guy that is emotionally unavailable, emotionally immature, doesn&#39;t know what he wants and has unresolved personal issues."

"OK, somebody let me know when they break up and her and Conrad get back together so I can start watching again Because I absolutely refuse to see that relationship. I will literally stop watching the whole entire show even to another season comes out. I do not care. I hate that relationship. Worst decision they ever did and I swear if they dragged this relationship out and they ended her and conrads relationship so fast I’m gonna be pissed"
"AHH SO EXCITED!! Please let her end with Jere, he looks so happy"
Jelly❤❤
"Great job, this video was very useful!"

I’m fine with Jenny changing the book’s ending so that Belly ends up with Jere - they have better chemistry anyways the chemistry with Conrad is lacking. Book fans don’t be mad
This gave me chills… in the best way

bruh look at all those jelly moments they are so perfect for eachother i cant believe conrad might actually be endgame. ik he probably will but he and belly never seemed to have chemistry and connection like jelly does
The happiness is just a fakeout that probably exists solely in the first episode the rest unadulterated drama and heartache.<br><br>It’s giving Jeremiah was just a moment of happiness but Conrad on the other hand… a moment of heartache but a lifetime of happiness. 😭😭😭 STOP

"Everyone hates on Jere for cheating on Belly but like don’t she cheat on him too? Like I get she was a teenager but cheating is cheating. And Conrad stole her when Jere was already with her, isn’t that worse than getting with her when she’s single??"
wait wait wait FINAL SEASON?
Please jellyfish moments were so cute ❤‍🩹❤ But then Belly might leave him for Conrad 😢😭

"This is a perfectly example of how you do a teaser trailer. You&#39;re not getting a synopsis or plot of the the entire series, but it perfect gives you a setting and a vibe."
Who else is here before this blows up
I’m fighting belly if she ends up with Conrad
I GOTTTTTTTT FUCKINGGG GOOSEBUMPS

Happy Bonrad season to everyone who celebrates!
The song mashup is CRIMINALLLLL
TAYLOR SONGS X TSITP = 😍😍😍
"You gotta love marketing tactics…they’re trying to keep fans hooked by only showing Jelly scenes until the very end and then suddenly change the mood and Conrad appears. Fans, especially Jelly ones, are in for a bad awakening once the show aires."
OMG
HELLO????
OMG OMG OMGGG
Я ЧЕКАЮЮ🎉🎉
From This Love to That&#39;s The Way I Loved You to August to Exile to Daylight and to Red!!!!  What a choice of songs.
LOVING HIM WAS RED OMG
I HAVE GOOSEBUMPS!! and Taylor&#39;s songs OMFG
the way that 2 second conrad moment made me feel more than any of the jeramiah scenes says it all
I thought this show ended?
I am NOT gonna enjoy all these belly and Jeremiah scenes
JENNY YOU GENIUS....&quot; i once believed love would be burning RED&quot;....&quot;and loving him was RED&quot;  Team Connie babyyy&#39;s coming home&lt;3
Always conrad team.. But bella is not good for conrad
OMG I AM NOT OK
CONRAD SUPREMACY 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫 I genuinely do not like Jeremiah and how he only wanted Belly AFTERRRR Conrad spoke up and got her. Lame asl.
Jelly all the wayyyy!!!!!!!
OMG ❤❤❤❤❤
AHHHH OMG OMG OMG
"Marò i brividi, I can&#39;t wait😍😍"
idc care about the book Jeremiah is so sweet in the series he&#39;s the better choice and he loves belly genuinely.. if they still goes with the book plot line they shouldn&#39;t have make his character this sweet. He deserves better!
stop because he took over the whole trailer that was supposed to be about belly and Jere with a simple “hey”. I read the book before seeing this and as a book girlie I am so happy they kept this scene the same!! It warms my heart. The subtle change in song too!! WE SEE YOU JENNY!! Team Connie forever Xo ❤♾️♾️
Everyone. Remain. Calm. 😱
i am so excited
"im team conrad all the way, but mannn jer looks so happy with her and so does she, please dont break his heartttt (unless hes gonna cheat on her like he did in the books then..)"
AHHH THE BEST SUMMER SHOW! I CAN’T WAIT FOR TSITP TO COME OUT!!!! Song choice amazing And go team Conrad ❤️❤️❤️
Goshhhh I love Jeremiah so much I know how the books end but I’m hoping we get a different one this time around TEAM JEREMIAH!!
Yess belly and Jeremiah
Lets gaurrr s3
❤Team Jelly forever❤
The ending is the only good part of this teaser! 😂 Jeremiah can drag his cheating butt to the street with the rest of the trash where he belongs!
I love taylor swift so much ❤❤

I AM SCAREAMING LOVING HIM WAS SO REDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
"uuuuuug huh are they doing this to us 😭😭😭😭 just emotionally abusing us like this 😭 of course this trailer makes me believe jellyfish won&#39;t end up together now. when all they show is them being happy, then of course it won&#39;t last 😭😭😭😭 UGH im gonna be  wreck this July. I think I won&#39;t even be able to make til July 😭"
they aren’t showing us any Belly &amp; Conrad moments so we shit our pants when the new season comes out
It doesn&#39;t matter if it was in the books or in the show i CANNOT see belly and jere together i just CAN&#39;T.
I HAVE BEEN WAITING EVERY SINGLE MINUTE FOR THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
OMGGG I know it&#39;s going to be Conrad and I&#39;m also Team Conrad but all those Belly and Jeremiah moments were too cuteeeee. He&#39;s going to be so heartbroken T_T
Everything was fine......untill I saw him🥲
HEY??!
Omgg the undertone and the not so subtle hint of Conrad taking over the entire trailer with just a &quot;hey&quot;!!!<br>Also i would be so heartbroken to see Jeremiah heartbroken if belly chooses Conrad as suggested by the lyrics which change right before &quot;it&#39;s golden&quot; to red😭😭<br><br>SMOOTH AF TRANSITION THOUGHH!!
The transition from Daylight to RED😮😮😮
I&#39;m dying!
🥰💓✨🫶🏾

I MEAN
Jere is better cus Conrad doesn’t care as much abt belly he is selfish
So sorry but team Jeremiah 😅🎉
god i just know conrad is gonna ruin their relationship
THE BELLYJERE DATING ERA OH NO ONE COULD EVE3RRRRR MAKE ME HATE YOUUU
I would love to pound Belly in all sorts of wonderful positions!!!!
GIVE IT TO ME NOW
So early
Got here only to listen to Tay ❤
THE CANDY FUCKING CANEEEEEEEEEE AGHHHHHH
IT&#39;S CONNIE BABYS TIME TO SHINEEEE
that &quot;hey&quot; owns everything.
TEAM CONNIE BABY
I will cry if she doesn’t end with jere
TEAM CONNIE BABY !!!!!!!
That “hey” is all I need to know there’s gonna be sooo much drama 😭
team anti Belly! 😂
"Already crying, I Can&#39;t believe they gonna split this beautiful couple 😭😭😭"
"I’m only gonna watch it, when Conrad is endgame! 🙈"
"THE WAY THAT MINI CANDY CANE, OH IT IS THE EXACT SCENE FROM BOOKS. As a book girlie, can&#39;t wait"
Can someone let me know which Taylor swift songs are playing in this teaser? I love it!!!! So excited
- How many times have you watched this?<br>+ Yes
"Just this trailer reminds me of sweet magnolias, Annie and Jackson looked and are so inlove bit there is this other guy that is the og endgame so they put it together and they aren’t that happy"
Are you Team JellyFish oder Conrad ?
That 1sec of conrad is what makes this trailer ❤
BLEYYJERE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
"YOU CAN SEE THE MOMENT BELLY SEES CONRAD, HE IS ALL THAT MATTERS IN THAT MOMENT. LOOKING WITH THOSE EYES, HOLDING HER BREATH. ❤"
When is the real trailer ?
I know this is going to be Conrad’s season but I can’t see jere unhappy he is literally a sweetheart and I hate when the writers have to make the sl commit a bad act to make their main lead look amazing especially when it’s so out of character…
The transition?!😭💗
IM SO EXCITEDDD
"I AM CRYING, THEY USED ALL BELLYJERE IN THE TRAILER. THEY ARE GATEKEEPING CONRAD SO BAD. I AM EXCITED.B"
"They should just create two endings. A happy ending with Jere. And one with Conrad. Please, so we don’t suffer 😭"
The audacity of him entering her life with a simple HEY . That&#39;s very nonchalant of Conrad 😭😭
Why is everything about Belly man. Conrad needs to move on and find someone who deserves him. I don&#39;t know why people keep shipping a toxic relationship. 😐
"belly and jeremiah are my roman empire, hate thissss if she ends with conrad"
always daylight(jer) never red ( conrad)
his hey was enough
Jellyfish forever
IMMA THROW UPPP
HEYYYYY CONNIE BABYY
Wasn’t she dating conrad the other day?
TEAM JER 4EVER🩵
Stop!!! The song!!! I can’t!!
TEAM JEREMIAH!!!!
I HATE CONRATTTTT
TEAM CONNIE BABY
"this, is my worst nightmare"
"Oh she def still loves him, even if you didn’t read the books her facial expression alone says it all."
i almost pooed my pants omg
The transition to Red once Conrad appeared was GOLD.
Final season 😭 Please Noooo
"I feel like I know how it&#39;s going to end (book or not), but, for once, I just wish that a show would just do the unexpected and have the main character end up with the person who just makes them feel happy, safe, and warm. In real life, relationships aren&#39;t necessarily supposed to be easy, but they&#39;re not supposed to rip you apart either. I think there&#39;s a difference between a relationship challenging you and one being challenging itself.<br><br>I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll end up with Conrad - the all or nothing, extreme happiness or crash-and-burn love - and it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like them together. Jeremiah just feels warm, genuine, realistic, and, well, golden. And that&#39;s how love should be."
Im so excited and the Taylor swift song choices are amazing ❤❤
CONRAD&#39;S HEY JUST CHANGED MY WHOLE LIFE Y&#39;ALL
team connie babyyyyy i&#39;m sooooooo ready
DO NOT RUIN JELLY. I LOVE THEM  TOGETHER
Daylight for our Golden Boyy!!❤Belkyjere ftw
being in a 4 year relationship and then switching back to the WORSE option is crazy
BROO JER!!!<br>I&#39;M FALLING EVEN MORE FOR HIM❤😭😭😭<br>HOW IS HE SO GORG!!!!
"Nobody can make me hate Jer🙂. Also the dancing in the street is so Delena coded, I love it"
Jeremiah Fisher your downfall is coming
NO STOP JEREMIAH DESERVES THE WORLD
I’m so excited!!! TEAM CONRAD!!!❤❤❤
that &#39;HEY&#39; just took my heart away 😭
Shut up!!! Why are all the major series ending this year😭😭😭 <br>That too THIS YEAR!!! When I am in my most significant year of schooling😭<br>It&#39;s just sad yk😔
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr7NbcCPYjk&amp;t=41"">0:41</a> BUT ITS GOLDEN AND CONRAD SHOW UP 🥹"
Bro Jere looks so happy 😊
"Conrad was brought on red: &quot;loving him was red&quot; whileee jeremiah was brought on daylight: &quot; i once believed love would be burning red, but its golden&quot; 😭😭😭"
"hey conrad, red ❤️‍🩹 ♾️ for you..."
It If I was Conrad I would have moved on with new girl he deserved better yikes the whole trailer is full of jelly yikes I’m not even team bonrad just want to see happy Conrad
AI MEU CORAÇÃO
What happened to her
Team Conrad all the way!!!!
Finally ❤
Stop I hate her
"<b><i>Belly should stay with Jeremiah, they have a lot of chemistry. I&#39;m team Jeremiah, by the way.</i></b>"
After all those love scenes and she still thinks bout Conrad god I hate her
"I swear to God if jeremiah&#39;s heart gets broken again, i&#39;ll rage"
conrad’s one word took over this whole teaser. i am so ready for this season
Lover being an album where Taylor thought that that was the person she was gonna spend the rest of her life with but it didn’t turn out to be…I see you Jenny Han we are getting a bonrad ending
OH MY GOD MY GIRLY DRAMA JUST CAME WITH THAT TRAILER
"I&#39;m team Conrad but seeing how happy Jere and Belly looked, I&#39;m questioning the ending😭"
TEAM JELLY forever

STOPPPPP IM SO HYPEDDDD AHDNDEJDMEJEJ I I CANT WAITTTT!! AND THE TRANSITION BETWEEN DAYLIGHT AND RED OMGGG
Amo amo amooo dios no puedo esperar
"I had to put the show on hold for a while when it first came out, because although I’d had the books for some time.. I kept putting off reading. Finally did and then binged the first two seasons. So glad I get to watch the final season/chapter &amp; enjoy it in real time and on time. Can’t wait! Now I need to hurry &amp; dust off we were liars &amp; get started on that before ITS premiere."
Noooooo what do you mean hey
WHO ELSE IS FRICKING SCREAMING!!!! 😱😱😱😱😱😍😍😍😍
"My problem is how do you be with someone who has been with your brother, or sister. It just feels wrong...."
JEREMIAH THEY COULD NEVER MAKE ME HATE YOU!!!
Everyone who hasn&#39;t read the books living in blissful ignorance - the books wreck one of the boys and then she chooses teh wrong guy :((((
THE SONGGG SAYSS IT ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
No matter what you guys say there&#39;s always this weird scenario whenever she sees Conrad
mais... pourquoi elle a un tisonnier à la main à la fin ?
OMG LA TRANSITION ENTRE DAYLIGHT ET RED (MES DEUX BÉBÉS 😍) EST INCROYABLE !!!!! 🤩
Now I know to which scene I&#39;m going to watch the series. With that &quot;Hi&quot; is going to be the end of the series for me. I don&#39;t wanna ruin my Belly and Jere vibe :D
"I want belly and jeremiahhh<br>He deserves to be happy, he literally told her he coudn&#39;t take it a second time and she about to break his heart 😭😭"
Omg I’m so exited!!
I can&#39;t wait for it
THE END HELLO?!??!
Half of the teaser looks like memories of dead wife 😅
we&#39;re so backk
DAYLIGHT 😭😭😭😭😭
Conrad stealing the spotlight with his 2 second appearance 🫠🫠 that man is so fine
"I just know Belly is gonna do my man Jere dirty, I do not trust the trailer"
Just one glance if Conrad is enough to maintain that hype....his &quot;hey&quot;🎀💕🤌🤌
ööööööööffffffffffffffffff CONRAD GO AWAY  !!!!!
Belly can play house with Jeremiah all she wants… but we all know her heart’s still at🫶🌊
i really really hope she ends upwith cocnrad guyyysssszzz😢
I&#39;m sorry but 2 second into the video jelly had me  smiling like a goof. In my opinion Lola has the best chemistry with Gavin outta two male lead&#39;s flawless
Help i cant stop replaying this teaser
Conrad ruined everything
Team Jeremiah💙
JENNY’S BOOK TO SCREEN REFERENCES I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO LOSE MY MIND
We all can see how beautiful and loved belly looks with jermiahhh<br>And look at himmm<br>He is so happyyy to finally be with herrrr<br>And we all know that mother wrote Daylight to actually let us know what true love feels likeee
I’m prepared to be wreckedddd omg 🥲😭 end of junior yearrrrr? Omgggg
I haven&#39;t seen this show. Bt the friend is more attractive than the brother
Okayy but they didn&#39;t  add the line of but its golden to Jeremiah
How can they dedicate daylight to Jeremiah
The fact Conrad had to stay a way for there relationship to be happy speaks volumes cuz as soon as he’s back everything changes
Finally dating eraaaaaa
Oh shittttttt

MY BREATH HITCHED
TEAM CONRAD GET JEREMIAH OUT OF HERE

im so excited for season 3! so  ive watched this like 6 7 times! (sorry i had to make the 6 7 joke) 💗🤣💗
I’m team Jeremiah❤
Jenny don’t mess this up….
The fact that the song cuts out before the &quot;but its golden&quot; part (that litteraly gives the entire meaning of the song) and is replaced with &quot;loving him was RED&quot; is SOOOOO telling
THIS IS SOOOO GOOOD!!!!!!
This season is going to be SO good. Is it to early to pop the champagne? 🎉🥂🍾
"Belly, my girl, this isn’t Baskin Robbins, you don’t get to sample every flavor and call it growth. PICK A BROTHER AND STICK WITH HIM!!!!!!!"
HIS ✨hey✨ I CAN‘T WAIT UNTIL JULY WHAAAAT

omgg finally its hereeee
NO WAYYYYYYYYYY THEY POSTD THE TEASER IM SCARED BUT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS IM TEAM JEREMIAH 💆‍♀💆‍♀
DAYLIGHT FOR JELLY IM SO HAPPYYTYYY
team Conrad and belly.
I thought season three been came out. Also how is this show still going maybe I need to tune in cause what
I&#39;m SO excited!! Not sure I can make it to July😭
"Belly is the biggest red flag, she&#39;s insufferable."
Jeremiah❤
The lack of Conrad is telling me that he is end game
"Ok, to the people who are hoping that Belly and Conrad will end up together, please get your hopes a bit lower cause I don&#39;t think Bonrad is endgame. Few important reasons why I think so :<br><br>1. If you look up the summer, I turned pretty on google. You&#39;ll see that Gavin and Lola are the first two in the cast, indicating that they&#39;ll be the lead this season. Look at a few examples: TVD, TATBILB, Xo, Kitty, and my life with the Walter Boys.<br><br>2. The Teaser was fully about Belly and Jermiah. Now, a lot of you might say that they&#39;re just trying to fool us. I don&#39;t think so. Most of the time, the 2nd lead barely gets any screen time, which happened here with Conrad.<br><br>3. MOST IMPORTANT REASON: Jenny Han said herself that there will be surprises this season that people will not expect. <br><br>I love both Conrad and Jermiah, and I&#39;ll be happy with whoever Belly chooses cause they&#39;re both amazing guys. This will be a hard season to watch as it is the last season, so I hope it ends out well for all of them. Thanks a lot to the cast and Jenny Han for blessing us with TSITP ❤️"
Conrad is just so fine!
Team Jeremiah since season 1
Ooh this is gonna be messy 😂 I can’t wait!
NOOOO I CANT WITH THE TAYLOR SWIFT SONGS?!!? THIS SEASON IS GONNA BE CRAZZY I CANT WAIT
BELLY BETTER FUCKING END UP WITH CONRAD OR IM DONE WITH MY LIFE JUST NO CONRAD OR NO ONE

I honestly can’t wait for July 16th 😁😁😁
They are still showing this crap?
COME ON!!!!! TEAM JEREMIAH ❤❤❤❤❤❤LIKE IF U AGREE 👍👍
I AM NOT READYYYYYYYYYY
The reason this show is not getting more seasons is because it sucked from season 2. She couldn&#39;t make a choice even in the books. I think it had a good premise but heading to final season 3 and she hasn&#39;t made a. Decision yet is a wack move. 😂
Team Jeremiah ❤❤❤
i need jelly so badly
This looks like all the fun they had in college together before 3 of them meet up for something and then everything just EXPLODES!!!!! <br>VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD ;)))
team jellyfish oh but the change from daylight to redddd what is jenny cooking omggggggggggg so excitedddd ahhhhhhh

"Conrad&#39;s &quot;hey&quot; is just everything.  I&#39;ve been team Conrad forever, and I just know it&#39;s going to be the belly Conrad ship as the endgame, and so it be. Oh god, now I&#39;m tensed. It has to be Conrad. Urgh."
OOOOMMMMGGGG THE DRAMA IS ABOUT TO BE ON AGAIN
I know Kelly is superior no matter what.
"If Conrad doesnt get his happy ending, me and my team will boycott this Season 3"
We are all team conrad anyway
This series is so frustrating especially this jere and belly... Belly is the problem!!! Sorry not sorry
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr7NbcCPYjk&amp;t=40"">0:40</a> right out of the book damn"
Lola Looks STUNNING here
Jenny wrecking Jeremiah and belly is diabolical
RED was honestly the best part abt this shi
THE WAY I SCREAMED AFTER HIS “hey” 🥹
"Se for para ver essas lindas cenas com Jeremiah e depois vê -la terminar com Conrad, nem quero assistir 😢"
AAA I CANT BELIEVE THE COUSINS HOUSE STORYLINE IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING
Conrad is so toxic honestly please no
She better not play ping pong again with them cause I can&#39;t freaking take it🤦🏽‍♀️
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr7NbcCPYjk&amp;t=31"">0:31</a> isn&#39;t that the sweater from the Bonrad hot chocolate scene from s2?"
Belly and Jer. No question.
Why final season no
i once believed love would be burning red ... <br><br>loving him was RED<br><br>what more hint do we need people ?!

"Who&#39;s gonna have their heart broken this summer? Of course, us..."
"The way he just said &quot;hey,&quot; and I already know all chaos is going to erupt."
This song will be perfect for conard and belly 🤌🫣😮‍💨🫠
No because I’m so happy that Belly and Jeremiah are together!!!!
jeremiah and belly moments looks so precious i almost cry seeing his smile i don&#39;t want to see him cry again 😔

All of this is probably only a montage in episode one 😅
When you&#39;re having your time with THE GUY but that one guy from 2022 shows up
That &quot;hey&quot; From conrad stole the whole damn show not even playing daylight could&#39;ve done anything cause red was played then😭😭😭
Nyc
Im dying ❤❤😭😭😭😭😭
It&#39;s just &quot;Hey&quot; that exploded my heart and changed whole scenario.. can&#39;t wait for bonrad to happen again
Jere doesn’t deserve daylight
"Conrad :Red: &quot;Loving him was red&quot;<br>Jer: Daylight: &quot;I once believed love would be burning red, but it&#39;s golden&quot;<br>YESSS I&#39;m officially scared who will belly choose?"
Let go conrad .yessssss❤🥰
"The trailer ends at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr7NbcCPYjk&amp;t=40"">0:40</a> actually the rest was just a black screen of nothingness....oh well <b>shrugs</b> it doesnt matterJere and belly are in bliss."
"Wtf😮 this is coming back, is there is story??"
THE WAY MY JAW DROPPED!!! STOP IT!!!
I&#39;m so excited for this!!!!! 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
FINAL SEASON????
"AH! So excited! I&#39;m glad they&#39;re not dragging it along for an indefinite number of seasons, but I hope it concludes well 🤍"
And ladies and gentleman with just one “hey” I am team Conrad again lmao
CONRADDDDDD⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Forever team conrad
What a Beautiful couple belly and jeremiah
No conrad no plissssss
I was not prepared to get ALL OF THE CHILLS TODAY
Ms Jenny Han plz give us a good ending 👀
💛❤️😭
Just dont break jere&#39;s heart . He is soooo goood in the series ...
Can’t lie I’ve never been able to be sold on the actor for Conrad. Not a bad actor but he never looked the part (from the books) which always made me less a fan of the fandom.
That was a hard watch
Just one second Hey from Conrad stole my whole heart😭❤️<br>The transition from Daylight to Red was just so smooth and fit perfectly well!!!
I once believed love would be burning red<br>But it&#39;s golden. Team Jelly!❤
Don&#39;t let her end up with Conrad😢
I’m team jellyfisher
Finallyyyyyyy!!!!!!!
Team Conrad 🤍
LETS GOO CONNIE BABY
Color me intrigued.
Team conrad
LOVING HIM .. YES THAT’S RIGHT
CONRAD WAS ABLE TO TAKE THE SPOTLIGHT WITH THAY &quot;Hey&quot; TEAM CONRAD 4 EVER!!!♡♡♡
This Jeremiah belly❤❤❤
Crazy…❤
MY TEAM JEREMIAH GIRLIES ❤ PRAY THAT IT STAYS THAT WAY!! AND THAT THE ENDGAME IS JEREMIAH AND BELLY BUT I STILL LOVE CONRAD AND THOSE CONRAD GIRLIES BUT IM TEAM JEREMIAH BABE
BYEEEEEEEEE OMGGGGGG ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
OH MY GAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
FINALLYYYYYYYY
"used to be team conrad but now that jeremiah and belly look so dreamy together i can&#39;t resist 😭😭🎀 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr7NbcCPYjk&amp;t=21"">0:21</a>"
LOLA &amp; GAVIN&#39;S CHEMISTRY ❤❤❤
Aww
"The beginning and the end of their journey are near, but a new journey will begin very soon in the certain future series. <br>Possible spin-off or movie? You will find out soon after the show is complete."
well goodbye team jelly 😣
STFU NOT DAYLIGHT IM GONNA LOSE MY SHI
This actress is so beautiful!!! She shines a lot.
"he&#39;s gonna do it, isn&#39;t he? i had hopes they changed the plot, i had hopes"
😭😭
OMGGGGGGG
"AHHhHh screaming, crying, throwing up. So excited to see how it ends."
Man they chose someone so charming in the role of Jeremiah that even usually people who prefer the angsty brooding boys can’t help but root for the sunshine boy. Belly just has better chemistry with him in this series and it’s literally undeniable.
i know most people are team conrad but i love Jer and Belly and i will forever be on jeremiah’s team lol that’s probably a hot take
Team Jellyfish ♾️ comeeee&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Team Jeremiah!
&quot;Hey&quot;
OMG 😲
TEAM CONRAD!!!!! I’m so excited I love belly and Jer but belly and Conny are my favvv
JUST DROP THE TRAILER
IM SCAREAMING IM SO EXCITED
oo myy god am screemingg.....Conrad&#39;s HEY just took the whole limelight...💕💕
It&#39;s the transition from &quot;I once believed love would be burning red!!! But it&#39;s golden&quot; to &quot;But loving him was red&quot; for me 😭
"If TSITP is gonna use any song, you better believe it’s gonna be a T Swift song"
Yasss can’t wait🤍🤍🤍
Jere&#39;s heart CANNOT be broken again. It would be pure evil.
AHHH im so excited!!!!
She doesn&#39;t end up with Jeremiah right ?? RIGHT ?????
"I mean seriously!!! Perfect teaser and songs!!! I screamed at Red!!! I also finished reading the 3rd book 2 days ago... So excited!!!<br><br>Note: Jeremiah is good but Conrad is &#39;THE ONE&#39;.... And the most important point is Belly (or should I call Isabel for this season) does not deserve any of them... I know I&#39;m being a bit judgy, but.... I said what I said...<br><br>Also,, Taylor Swift&#39;s song &#39;The way I loved you&#39; is Belly the whole seasons...."
Team jellyfish 💗💜
"IMMA COMBUST, RED ?????????? RED???????????????????? MY SONG WITH MY FAV SHIP ???? FOULLLLL"
Was cute until it became a horror movie at the end
The use of a Taylor Swift song in every TSITP trailer is healing for millennial and gen z girls
I can’t wait
Dont know whyyy immm tearing upppp❤❤
Is it on Netflix yet 😫😫😫
team connie wya
i have disliked this video. I have one thing to say forever team conrad lesgoo
Can&#39;t waittttttt!!!❤
DAYLIGHTT AND REDDD AHHHHHHH
"I want Conrad ,to be the end game."
Shee cut her hairrrrrr❤❤❤❤
Omg ❤can’t wait! Jeremiah soooo hot!🤗😽😻
conbelly season is HERE ahhhhh!<br>red is the perfect song for them frrrrrrr
Omg omg omg
Thank god they cut the word golden from the Jeremiah scenes because I would have been so pissed
I can&#39;t believe ittttt
BONRAD FOR LIFEEE
Team Conrad.
“Conrad is the Sun and when the Sun comes out everything else just disappears”<br>Do I need to say more
Superrrr excited for the finaleee!!!❤<br>RED  WAS JUST PERFECT FOR THAT &quot;HEY&quot;
Team Conrad or team Jeremiah?
"Im sat and ready omg, lets go bonrad ❤❤❤"
"As a Jeremiah Stan, I know he won’t get the girl, hope finds someone that will choose him first"
Ahhh so excited team Jere!❤
Them starting the show from Conrad on taylor swift and ending it by taylor swift is ironic 😭🙇‍♀️🥹
"Daylighhhhttt and redddddd in the backkkk and lola,gavin and chrisssss ❤❤❤❤❤❤ canttttt wait"
The summer I turned pretty and Taylor swift 💕💕
early asf
IDGAF CONRAD IS THE BEST PART OF THIS WHOLE TEASER!!!! 🫠😭😍
So so excited ❤❤❤
jenny rlly leaked all the happy bellyjere scenes and ended the teaser with a scene where belly realises she never stopped loving conrad i love her 😭😭😭
Team Jellyfish ❤❤❤❤❤
im crying
"the crime is that belly is making out with the other fisher brother in the same sweatshirt as she did making out with Connie, YOUR 18 GIRL.. breathe... <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/KsIfY6LzFoLM6AKanYDQAg""></a> like... live your life on ur own, it&#39;s healthier that way!"
LETS GO CONRAD
"I feel like this just proved bonrad is still endgame because it shows no matter how happy belly is with jere, it always leads back to her and conrad."
AHHH I crashed out when it was belly and Jere but when I saw Conrad it made it better TEAM CONRAD 🩷🩷🩷
If Belly doesn&#39;t wanna end up with Conrad I Voluntary Will 😂
"nah conrad is just rude, jeremiah si the green flag"
conrad😭
Jeremiah&#39;s eyes are so pretty
i am so excited
They are so cute please let Jeremiah and belly be endgame Conrad already had his chance
omg can&#39;t wait to watch
the moment she sees him it all comes rushing back VIBES omg
"omg cant wait for s3, I remember august of 2023 when i binge watched both s1 and s2 tgt as s2 was about to end, time flies by so fast, first I was team jere then I became team conrad cause i went on social media and ppl were on conrad&#39;s side and it made sense but now I&#39;m stuck between the 2 choices,"
"Thank God she chose Jeremiah, Conrad just drives her crazy and can&#39;t decide for himself if he wants Belly or not."
Can she just choose one of them already for f sake  GOD 😑
I need Jelly to be endgame. PLEASE I NEED THEM TO HAVE AN HAPPY ENDING 😭😭😭😭😭😭 Ik I&#39;m being delusional at this point but 😭😭😭😭
"The Taylor Swift, daylight song sounds different a lot better maybe a remastered version."
TEAM JEREMIAH POR SIEMPREEE
Team Jeremiah
O kadar şeyden sonra bu kız nasıl conrad a döner aklım almıyor.
I HAD GOOSEBUMPS!! HOLY SHIT THAT WAS GOOD AGHHH
OH MY GOSHHHH
Let’s go CONRAD
"conrad entering with a candy cane in his mouth is ACTUALLY genius, in s2 &quot;I brought candy&quot;😭😭😭💗"
He said &quot; Hey &quot; ...oh Nooo..it means something deeper❤❤❤
Team conrad gooooooooo
HEY

This is one of the best teasers I’ve ever watched
This is really too much. Enough. Didn&#39;t you get away from this story? Isn&#39;t it enough that it&#39;s destroying the relationship between two brothers? I&#39;m really angry
HONESTLY. why is belly still DECIDING which brother has her heart??😭
Conrad👍🤧
TEAM CONRAD FOREVER ❤❤❤❤
2 TS songs???????? damn
"uhh so we are going to watch jeremiah and belly hooking up all the time being happy  and what conrad is going to be lika a third weel and be miserable and ALONE? and last episode she is going to be oh no i love conrad? y yeah no thanks, <br>why dont belly and jeremiah end up together and we watch conrad finding the love of his life with someone else?"

JUSTICE FOR CONRAD 😭😭😭😭
TEAM JELLYFIIISH
If he cheats I’m team Conrad all the way (also it’s cheating even if they’re broken up for 2 days idc) But I will always remember that they literally had to make Jeremiah cheat on belly for Conrad TO STAND a chance and y’all ain’t ready for the conversation 🥰

"I’m beyond excited for this final season—just thinking about how far we’ve come with these characters makes me emotional already. Every summer, every moment, every heartbreak and every little smile has led us to this point. It’s been such a beautiful, chaotic, and emotional journey watching their lives unfold, and now that it’s coming to an end, I’m really hoping it’s the ending that feels right. For me, that means seeing Conrad and Belly finally get their chance. They’ve both grown so much, and even through all the ups and downs, their connection has always felt so strong and real. I truly believe they’re meant for each other, and I hope this last chapter lets them figure things out and find their way back for good😭❤❤❤🤞💯"

"I AM SHAKING,RED PLAYING FOR BELLY AND CONRAD OH MY HEART"

It’s really a teen and kids’ show it’s a failure. Amazon Prime should have canceled it after the first season.
